# Wiki Schema

## Authority

1. Code, tests, schemas, migrations, and configuration describe current behavior.
2. Approved specifications and ADRs describe intended behavior and rationale.
3. Wiki pages are derived synthesis.
4. Conversations and failed hypotheses are not evidence.

## Required page metadata

- `id`
- `kind`
- `status`
- `summary`
- `verification.base_commit`
- `verification.evidence_fingerprint`
- `evidence`

## Material updates

Update the wiki for behavior, boundaries, dependencies, contracts, invariants, operations, architectural decisions, and confirmed reusable failure modes.

Do not record formatting, transient debugging, failed hypotheses, or unchanged implementation details.
